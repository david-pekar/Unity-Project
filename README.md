Summary:

This is a two player battle game. Each character will start on opposite sides of the map.
The players each start with 100 health and a score of zero. The goal of each player is to 
get the other player to zero health. If one of the players gets to zero health, 
each characters health will reset to zero, players will each respawn at opposite points
of the map, and the player's health that is still above zero will have their score 
increase by one.
